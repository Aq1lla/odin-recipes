<h1>Pizza</h1>

Ingredients:
2 ounces prosciutto, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 refrigerated pizza crust
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
3 ½ tablespoons water
1 ½ teaspoons dried oregano
½ teaspoon white sugar
1 pinch salt
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
8 leaves basil - stacked, rolled into a cigar shape, and thinly sliced

Directions:
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Step 2: Place prosciutto in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
Step 3: Lightly oil a pizza pan, baking sheet, or baking stone. Press pizza dough out onto the pan, spreading to the edges, but avoiding pulling the dough apart.
Step 4: Combine tomato paste, water, oregano, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Spread an even layer over the dough. Reserve remaining mixture for use on another pizza. Sprinkle minced garlic over the sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella on top, then the fried prosciutto, then the rest of the mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle sliced basil leaves over pizza. 
Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven until cheese and crust are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Let pizza cool for 3 to 4 minutes, slice, and serve.
