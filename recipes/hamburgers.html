		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The best hamburger that goes with beer and potatoes like strawberries with champagne</p>

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
				<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon minced onion</li>
				<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
				<li>1 (15 ounce) can chili without beans</li>
				<li>6 hot dog buns</li>
				<li>6 slices American cheese</li>
				<li>3 dill pickles, cut into strips lengthwise</li>
			</ul>
			
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
				<li>Mix the ground beef, Worcestershire, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper. Shape into 6 thin patties. Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place the cheese slices on the burgers during the last minute of cooking.</li>
				<li>Heat the can of chili in a saucepan until hot. Cut the hamburger patties in half and put two halves into a hot dog bun, side by side. Place the pickles in the buns and top with chili.</li>
